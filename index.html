      <p>The DirtDevil Spider M607 is a cheap entry-level vacuum robot. It does not feature optical mapping, but rather randomly moves around until it hits an obstacle and then turns to avoid it. This works reasonably well, but I purchased the robot in order to modify it.</p>

      <p>The Atari ST Mega home computer was produced from 1985 to 1994. It uses the Motorola 68k line of chips as its main processor with a 16 bit data bus. The Atari ST Mega that I have came with an Atari Megafile hard disk and Atari SM124 monochrome monitor. In the following I describe the modifications I have made to make the computer useable in the 21st century.</p>
