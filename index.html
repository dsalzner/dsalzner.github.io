      <!-- Was -->
      <p>For quite some time I've wanted to purchase a 360 lidar for one of my robots. They give the robot the ability to measure distances of obsticles surrounding it. 360 lidars are commonly used on robotic vacuums, but have been available for hobbyists for some time. I just couldn't justify the price for hobbyist projects. Recently the 'YouYeeToo' / 'WayPonDev' / 'LDRobot' 'FHL-LD20' or 'D200 Lidar Kit' came to by attention. It costs only 48 Eur. Let's see, if I can get it to work. If the signal is clean enough we can try Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.</p>

      <p>Amateur radio and software defined radio is a big field with a lot to learn. It touches on various fields of technology from voice communication, but also digital transmission for WiFi, Smart Home and IoT. As such I've come into contact with it from various angles from time to time. The following summarizes what I've learned about receivers, antennas, connectors, cables, useful software and some signals I've received.</p>

      <p>Most would agree that Sim City 4 is by far the best city-building simulation game. It's a 20 year old game that hasn't received any updates since. But recently there have been significant advancements in plug-in development for the game. I've written a plug-in for Sim City 4 that allows viewing game metrics in a web browser. The web browser can run on a secondary monitor, smart phone or tablet. This adds basic second-screen/multi-monitor capabilities to the game. </p>
