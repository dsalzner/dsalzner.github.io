<p>Three common ways to build a cocktail mixing machine can be found on the internet: The first uses so-called peresaltic pumps for each bottle. They pump the liquid into a glas. The second and thrid way use dispensers commonly seen in bars. They are attached to the bottles and the bottles are then hung upside down. The dispensers pour a fixed amount of liquid, usualy 2cl to 4cl, when a glas is pushed against them from below. In such cocktail mixing machines, mechanics are required to move a glas below the dispensers and push upward against them. Either, as in the second method, by rotation or, as in the third method, by linear slide. The first design requires very expensive pumps in order to achieve a decent flow rate of over 300 ml/sec
For my design I have chosen the third method: dispensers and the linear sliding approach. To me using dispensers is more visually appealing and cleaner as the liquid never touches any part of the machine but the dispensers. Apart from that it can be easily scaled up or down depending on your requirements, as we will be using a belt drive for the linear slide and we can easily extend this.
Note that you need quite a lot of bottles, dispensers and thus a large machine to mix cocktails: A Singapore Sling for instance requires eight different ingredients. Some of which should normally be cooled. A proper Caipirinha needs ice and lemon slices which can’t be dispensed. A Tequila Sunrise requires Orange Juice. Orange Juice comes in Tetra Paks, which look awful in a cocktail mixing machine. Perhaps a mixed approach with perestaltic pumps for the visually less appealing ingredients or ingredients that need to be cooled is a good idea - then they can be placed in a fridge near by. I didn’t go that far.</p>

<p style="font-size: 60%;" align="right">When</p>

<p>The cocktail machine was originally intended for a larger party, but didn’t get finished on time. This was expected though, because I started too late and working on something like this for a day and 4 or 5 evenings isn’t enough, even when you have most of the parts. In the end the problem was sourcing more powerful motors to push against the cocktail dispensers - I had underestimated the force and preceision that is required to get the dispensers to function. Additionally the software was not in a very appealing state. The machine was approximately 85% there the evening before the party. In the following two  weeks, with out much rush, it was finished in another day or two.</p>

<p style="font-size: 60%;" align="right">Background</p>

<p>In order to get the cocktail machine working in the short time frame I used a lot of components I already had and tried to cut as many corners as possible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>geared stepper motors from a very early attempt of mine at CNC milling</li>
  <li>the stepper motor controller board (adruino uno + gcode shield) from my CNC mill with a standard ATX computer power supply</li>
  <li>rooted Android Tablet running CyanogenMod, QPython, the Python-Flask micro web framework and serial port access via the QPython SL4A Android bindings in order to stomp a touchscreen UI out of the ground in a minimum amount of time, that would send GCode CNC milling commands via usb on-the-go adapter straight to the Arduino without the need to write a custom firmware or design a protocol on the Arduino.</li>
  <li>industry standard aluminium profiles and right-angle brackets to build a stable light-weight frame quickly and be able to move components ever so slightly to make adjustments and reduce tension on the materials.</li>
  <li>linear ball bearings running on 16mm diameter aluminium tubes, terminated with hose clamps.</li>
  <li>very large hose clamps to fix stepper motors to the aluminium profiles</li>
  <li>some small hand-made wooden pieces to attach components</li>
  <li>and bar dispensers ordered from the web</li>
</ul>
